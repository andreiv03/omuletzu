# Omuletzu'

These days it is not very easy to create a professional Discord bot that works well with TypeScript and any other package. From now on, you can use this template for any Discord application you create, and it's easy to set up!

## Setup

1. Create and setup a new application on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Get the Application Id from the **General Information** section or from the URL of the page and paste it inside `src/utils/deploy-commands.ts` file.
3. Create a new **.env** file in the root folder that will contain the text `SECRET_TOKEN=<YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN>`. You can get the **SECRET_TOKEN** from the **Bot** section by pressing the **Reset Token** button.
